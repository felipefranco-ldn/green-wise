## ðŸš€ About Me

Hello! I'm a Product Designer, Architect and Full Stack Web Developer...

I am from Bogota, Colombia, and am currently based in London but have also lived in Italy, Germany and Sweden.

After several years in the architecture industry, I decided to start a career in tech to be part of London's exciting and growing tech scene!

I am passionate about design, science, technology and nature and love travelling, visiting new places, discovering new food and learning languages...

Look forward to starting a new chapter in my professional life after learning a whole new set of tech skills at BrainStation!

## About GreenWise

TPlanet Earth is in crisis! And taking care of the environment is arguably the most urgent challenge that humanity faces nowadays. This issue needs to be tackled by the society as a whole but also from an individual perspective, as small changes in a personâ€™s behaviour and daily choices can have a huge compound impact.

As a starting point, we all need to be aware of the environmental impact of our daily activities. Then we can compare that information with some targets that could help drive a positive change; that way we will know what needs to be improved and by how much.

GreenWise will provide an easy-to-use tool to visualise a userâ€™s carbon footprint and will help them make informed decisions on how to contribute to the transformation of our planet for the better.

This is accomplished in three simple steps:

a. Estimate
b. Reduce
c. Compensate

## Getting started with GreenWise

In your console:

1. cd into the root directory and then cd into the client folder.
2. To install all necessary dependencies, run the command:
   `npm i`
3. Once all dependencies have been installed, start the localhost by running the command:
   `npm start`
4. GreenWise should start running in your browser locally in port 3000.
   [http://localhost:3000] (open in your browser if it doesn't open automatically)
   The page will reload if you make edits.
   You will also see any lint errors in the console.
